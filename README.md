Nothing to say. I made this project in a few hours knowing nothing about Node and now I just want to sleep so Will put anything in here plus some important settings intel.

I hate callbacks

Install youtube-dl and ffmpeg via homebrew. If you're on linux/windows fuck u for now, I'll update it later.

- npm install

- npm run server

- be happy
